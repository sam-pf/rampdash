# Mockup Dashboard of Ramp Game LARA Activity

The mockup dashboard here has been generated by taking an example from [the
excellent ag-grid-vue-example
page](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-vue-example) and modifying it to
show what we may want for [a ramp game LARA
activity](https://authoring.concord.org/activities/8186/) being built at the
Concord Consortium.

# How to make this demo work

Locally, you can use `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.  For production,
use `npm run build`.

You can visit [here](https://physicsfront.com/rampdash) to see what this demo
looks like in the wild.
