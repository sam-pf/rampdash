# Mockup Dashboard of Ramp Game LARA Activity

The mockup dashboard here has been generated by taking an example from [the
excellent ag-grid-vue-example
page](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-vue-example) and modifying it to
show what we may want for [a ramp game LARA
activity](https://authoring.concord.org/activities/8186/) being built at the
Concord Consortium.

Clearly, this mockup demo is non-functional as all data are fake, and it is
incomplete (Page 5 missing, as is Page 1 (?)).  The purpose is not to show
full functionalities.  Its purpose is to show what minimal information must
be coordinated under the hood for this type of dashboard to function.

# How to make this demo work

First, `npm install`.  Then `npm run dev` while developing locally.  For
production, use `npm run build`.

looks like in the wild.
