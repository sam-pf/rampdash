# Mockup Dashboard of Ramp Game LARA Activity

The mockup dashboard here has been generated by taking an example from [the
excellent ag-grid-vue-example
page](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-vue-example) and modifying it to
show what we may want for [a ramp game LARA
activity](https://authoring.concord.org/activities/8186/) being built at the
Concord Consortium.

This mockup demo is incomplete.  Page 5 is missing, as is Page 1 (?)).  Also,
in a more developed version, the full history of student responses to a
question and the full history of MCBKT diagnostic for student game play
should be available.  That type of fuller information may be accessed when a
user clicks the corresponding in-cell element and gets sent to a different
page or a popup element.

For the initial version here, the purpose is to show what minimal information
must be coordinated under the hood for this type of dashboard to start to
function.

# How to make this demo work

First, `npm install`.  Then `npm run dev` while developing locally.  For
production, use `npm run build`.

looks like in the wild.
